## Synopsis
FlowLy presents web development categories to users and allows them to create and view flow charts to help develop their understanding of common web development concepts

## Technologies Utilized
FlowLy is a MEAN Stack Application

- The client side is written is AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and some vanilla JS
- Server side it runs a Node.JS server with Express
- The database side is Mongo and the whole application is hosted on Heroku

## Features
- Users can search and browse common web development categories such as HTML, Javascript, ExpressJS, AngularJS, etc.
- Users can submit new categories
- Users can also submit new concepts with flow diagrams for every category, but these concepts are subject to admin approval
- Concepts that receive the most stars are displayed first
- Users can either upload images they make outside the application or they can create a flow chart using the application's basic flow chart maker and upload that image
- Admin users are able to manage the content and users on the site. This allows them to approve concepts and make other users admin users.
- Images are stored using the ospry.io library. This all happens client side and to scale a better solution would be needed.

## The Approach Taken  
----------------------

-Our Approach was pretty clean and smooth.
-We set the tempo by initially meeting at the end of class on the day we were assigned the project and brainstormed a few solid project ideas but we gave it until the next day for us to decide on an idea
-The next day we were able to decide on an idea within a very short amount of time and then started drawing out wire frames.  We were able to plan out our inital models and our templates / directives and the pages that these directives will render on.  
-By describing our models/collections as well as our views/templates, we were able to proceed with our coding process.
- The first few days of our coding process cnosnisted of:

	 1. building our server so we could have model data in Mongodb to experiment with
	 2. implementing user authentication / passport
	 3. building our directives along with the routes that would establish the connection between client and server

-After we completed the MVP, we moved forward with styling, as well as additional features that we figured wouldn't hurt to add if we had time, like extra CRUD functionality.


-------------------------
## Unsolved Problems, etc.
-------------------------

The one thing we could have done better was wire-framing in greater detail.  It seems like app design could have been organized a little more carefully in order to have a clear layout plan from the start.  Other than that, things went well.
