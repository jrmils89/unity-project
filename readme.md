## Synopsis
FlowLy presents web development categories to users and allows them to create and view flow charts to help develop their understanding of common web development concepts

## Technologies Utilized
FlowLy is a MEAN Stack Application

- The client side is written is AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and some vanilla JS
- Server side it runs a Node.JS server with Express
- The database side is Mongo and the whole application is hosted on Heroku

## Features
- Users can search and browse common web development categories such as HTML, Javascript, ExpressJS, AngularJS, etc.
- Users can submit new categories
- Users can also submit new concepts with flow diagrams for every category, but these concepts are subject to admin approval
- Concepts that receive the most stars are displayed first
- Users can either upload images they make outside the application or they can create a flow chart using the application's basic flow chart maker and upload that image
- Admin users are able to manage the content and users on the site. This allows them to approve concepts and make other users admin users.
- Images are stored using the ospry.io library. This all happens client side and to scale a better solution would be needed.
